How to start:
- Import dataset into mongodb
- Start mongodb
- Run server.js
- Go to localhost:3000


What was done:
- Webpages and links fully working
- sign up / log in / log out fully working
- backend including querying, controllers and models.
- Author analytics show no author found on page when no author found in result
- Author analytics show results in JSON text format on page since we do not know how to render that into pug

We did all the controllers, models, queries, draw pie, draw bar, everything
but it's just that we were stuck on how to render the JSON-formatted result into pug webpage.
